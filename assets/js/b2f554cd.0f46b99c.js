The Token Sale Smart Contract enables projects to crowdsource through a token sale, configuring different parameters like whitelisting requirements and token vesting. \\n\\nThe teams of EOSTARTER and EOS Costa Rica have started working on the [Platform Application](https://github.com/eostarter/token-sale-platform) and the [Platform’s smart contract](https://github.com/eostarter/eostarter.sale-smart-contract) open-source GitHub repositories. The Token Sale Platform offers a suite of services for investors and project owners seeking funding. Project owners will set up a token sale pool, configure the parameters, and launch a public token sale. Upon EOSTARTER’s approval, the token sale will begin on the established sale date and vest accordingly for investors and project owners.\\n\\n<!--truncate-->\\n\\n## The Platform in Detail\\n\\nThe  Platform Application will be built on top of an open-source Smart Contract deployed on the EOS Mainnet. The project owner deposits project tokens to be held by the smart contract in order to be sold at a predetermined price for EOS tokens that will also be held by the smart contract. Investors and Project owners can then claim their tokens according to transparent rules and vesting schedules stored on-chain. You can view the initial platform’s [user flow here](https://medium.com/eostarter/eostarter-tokensale-platform-scope-of-work-4cb153c33ab6).\\n\\nThe Token Sale Platform proposal became one of the most backed initiatives by the EOS community during the first season of the Pomelo Grant, having received support from over 185 contributors and more than US$20K in matching funds from the ENF. Review our application [here](https://pomelo.io/grants/eostartertsc). Additionally to developing the smart contracts, we expect to include other features for a broader scope of the platform.\\n\\n“We couldn’t be more excited to announce this partnership that will enable us to deliver on the promise of an equitable project launchpad for the EOS Ecosystem that we proposed on our Pomelo Grant Proposal,” said Hernan Arber from EOSTARTER. “All the project’s development costs will be transparent on the EOSTARTER account, and the code will be open-sourced as a public good for the entire EOS Ecosystem.” \\n\\n“Our team is excited and honored to be the core development group to build the smart contracts behind the Token Sale Platform. We believe that our skillset and tech stack will add value to EOS token holders and investors,” said Edgar Fernández from EOS Costa Rica/Edenia. “To this point, we are confident the Platform will exceed the expectations of the Pomelo grant supporters who trusted the proposal as a potentially impactful idea and EOS Costa Rica will become the ‘go-to’ dev team for the future Pomelo grants.”\\n\\nHernan Arber also referred to the EOS Costa Rica team: “their professionalism and technical abilities have been delivering consistent improvements to our community and they are the key developers of the EOS Rate tool among many important EOS projects.”\\n\\nFollow us on social media to keep up to date with new updates about the Token Sale Platform and other related projects.

So far, 21 validators are producing blocks on Proton. Designed to work with high-volume apps, it offers several features to streamline payment processing, including identity verification, zero gas fees, and industry-leading speed (reaching up to 4,000 transactions per second). Known as “the payment blockchain,” it uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism and allows Proton (XPR) token holders to select block producers by voting.\\n\\nRegulated by a Governing Council, Proton offers a decentralized governance model that requires pre-qualifying as a block producer candidate, compliance review, and a unique voting system for all council members. Proton enables the allocation of network resources where apps can rent while inflation rewards help fund the protocol development. Also, long-term Proton token holders may earn staking rewards in exchange for their votes.\\n\\nMoreover, Proton offers a Proton wallet mobile app that enables users to store multiple cryptocurrencies in one place. It also allows integration with hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor.\\n\\n## Getting Started with the Proton Affiliate Program\\n\\n<figure className=\\"video_container\\">\\n  <iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"380\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6SgSvg7Dr44\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" allowFullScreen={true}>\\n  </iframe>\\n</figure>\\n\\nIn particular, the Proton [Affiliate Program](https://earnproton.com/) allows anyone with a Proton wallet and a completed KYC (Know Your Client) profile to refer new users to the app. They will be able to send a referral code and earn rewards in return for every invitee that signs up and completes the on-boarding process. This referral will be stored on a smart contract, preventing abuse on the network.\\n\\nOnce a new user receives this referral link, they will be prompted to choose a username and he or she will have 72 hours to download the Proton wallet, create an account, and go through the KYC process. After these few steps, their wallet will be active and ready to be used. Then, the person who referred the new user will receive payment automatically in XPR, the Proton native token, as a reward.\\n\\nThe Proton [Affiliate Program](https://earnproton.com/) is in the beta stage (only for selected countries) and welcomes new and existing Proton users to help us validate its functionalities.

This artwork, a digital collage of images called “Everyday – The First 5000 Days,” became the highest-selling NFT to date. In this digital art piece, Mike Winkelmann (known as the Beeple) chronicles seven years of daily sketches done by the artist, but what’s most remarkable is how it is shaking the art world. \\n\\nBeeple’s historic achievement leveraged NFTs to certify true ownership of this digital asset. In that sense, Beeple transferred his artwork to the buyer, and even if it’s in digital format, Beeple is no longer the owner of his work. The transfer was registered on the blockchain, immutably to certifying its new ownership. \\n\\n![How to blockchain works](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eoscostarica/eoscostarica.io/master/static/img/blog/nfts-for-enterprise/How%20blockchain%20works.jpeg)\\n\\nWhat Beeple did is the same as in the physical world. A painter would sell the original artwork to a buyer and have no other means to claim ownership. The painter might keep the jars of paint and brushes, but the piece belongs now to the buyer. It’s complicated thinking of this in the digital world. That’s when NFTs and blockchain technology appeared to solve a very known problem in the digital art world. \\n\\n\\n<!--truncate-->\\n\\n## What Are NFTs?\\n\\nNFTs (or non-fungible tokens) are unique, rare, and indivisible cryptographic tokens representing true ownership of a digital good. An NFT contains unique information from the asset that makes it distinguishable from other tokens. Since no two NFTs are the same, they cannot be exchanged with one another. For example, [NFTs are comparable](https://www.coindesk.com/what-are-nfts) to festival tickets, where each ticket has the purchaser’s information, date of the event, and the venue. Since each token is unique and holds this distinctive data, it’s virtually impossible to be traded with anyone else. \\n\\nAlso, NFTs live on a blockchain, so information such as ownership and the token’s characteristics are easily verifiable, making it extremely difficult for fake or copied collectibles to circulate in the network. For instance, the buyer of Beeple’s “Everyday – The First 5000 Days” is now registered as the valid owner of the art piece, and this cannot be altered unless the buyer decides to sell or transfer it again. This is similar to collecting physical art. If you buy a sculpture and place it in your living room, it is yours now, and you decide if you wish to send it to someone else. You wouldn’t want to divide or multiply your sculpture. The same happens with NFTs. \\n\\n## What Is Blockchain?\\n\\nThe way a blockchain transaction works impacts how these NFTs solve many of the digital arts’ problems. If you’re not familiar with what blockchain is and how it works, [this article we published](https://eoscostarica.io/blog/what-is-blockchain) is a great way to start. In a few words, a typical blockchain transaction begins when a user performing a transaction (either of value or registering a new record) asks for validation. The transaction must be validated by a peer-to-peer network and is presented as a block of information. Once the users in the network approve the transaction because it complies with the terms, the new block is added to the chain with a unique hash code identifying it. Once it is registered in the blockchain, it cannot be altered or revoked. If a user wants to make a change, a new transaction must be requested.\\n\\nIn that sense, blockchain represents an opportunistic way to certify the validity of a transaction. For example, blockchain is slowly doing the job of notarizing documents more straightforward and keeping complete traceability of transactions across the supply chain. In the case of NFTs, it then makes sense that we can register ownership certificates of these art collectibles in a blockchain. That way, we will be able to verify who’s the actual owner of, for instance, Beeple’s “Everyday – The First 5000 Days.”\\n\\nBeeple’s sale is far from being the only use case of NFTs. Besides art, some of the most popular use cases of NFTs include:\\n* Gaming: Games such as [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), which lets a user collect and breed digital cats represented as NFTs with distinctive attributes, are using this technology. When breeding two cats with different features, their offspring would be rare and more exclusive. NFTs for games enable players to collect digital assets and blur the line between the virtual and the real worlds. Another example is [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), where a user can collect creatures to battle, build, and hunt for in-game treasure.\\n* Collectibles: Similar to use cases in games, NFTs enable collectors to buy, sell, and trade digital collectibles such as tokenized versions of athletes’ and celebrities’ cards. Platforms such as [NBA TopShot](https://nbatopshot.com/) or [Terra Virtua](https://terravirtua.io/) leverage the scarcity and uniqueness of NFTs to offer a vibrant marketplace on the blockchain.\\n* Virtual worlds: Platforms such as [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) or [Upland](https://www.upland.me/) create a metaverse where players own the digital assets used to create virtual worlds. A user can create, own, and monetize their virtual land and other digital assets within a community of players.\\n\\n\\n## NFTs for Enterprise\\n\\nOnce we understand the reach of NFTs and how they can certify data with a rich user experience, it is possible to imagine other uses. For instance, if we can verify the ownership of an art piece or an athlete’s virtual card, wouldn’t this technology help us manage documentation? The following are some thoughts on use cases that can happen in the enterprise environment with the increasing popularity of NFTs:\\n\\n### 1. NFTs for Real Estate: \\n\\nGoing back to the examples of The Sandbox and Upland, a user can own and monetize parcels of virtual land. Wouldn’t it make sense also to certify ownership of real properties? NFTs can create a seamless system to transfer ownership, and we can translate this to how real estate documentation is processed. [NFTs can transform](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliakarayaneva/2021/04/08/nfts-work-for-digital-art-they-also-work-perfectly-for-real-estate/?sh=e29f6ac43f33) the real estate industry on several touchpoints across a transaction. \\n\\nNFTs and blockchain can allow users to register a transaction using a significantly less amount of paperwork. Users can even reduce costs and processing times by cutting the middlemen such as notaries. Owners can tokenize their properties and validate their ownership using a blockchain, where no one can alter or delete their registry. Then, a transaction is executed between two parties (a seller and a buyer and it can be validated truthfully by a network of computers. \\n\\n### 2. NFTs for Patents and Intellectual Property:\\n\\nRecently, [IBM said they’ve been working](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/its-no-nba-top-shot-or-beeple-but-ibm-is-making-patent-nfts.html) on bringing intellectual property and corporate patents to the blockchain. Along with IP specialist firm [IPwe](https://ipwe.com/), they will start representing patents as NFTs. Through this, they plan to store information on a blockchain network to increase transparency and provide a better way to engage and transact patents. \\n\\nOn the other hand, [Bluebox](ttps://bluebox.info/nft/) is a platform that enables artists to monetize their music differently. The platform turns real-world assets such as music rights into NFTs. Owners can then track and withdraw their royalties earnings directly from their accounts. \\n\\n### 3. NFTs for Legal and Insurance:\\n\\nNFTs are a safe and seamless way to register legal information. Imagine that each contract is a digital asset. Instead of printing and signing by hand an agreement, you will digitally sign them and store them on a blockchain as NFTs. The contract is unique and will belong to you. There are hundreds of uses for NFTs in this space. From insurance documents to labor agreements, NFTs can help digitize negotiations. \\n\\nMoreover, NFTs can serve to certify ownership and origin of products. For example, an NFT can hold information about fashion, technology devices, or medicines to minimize counterfeiters. It can also ensure traceability and accountability of these goods and allow better trust between the seller and end customer. \\n\\n### 4. NFTs for Supply Chain and Inventory Management:\\n\\nNFTs can store any kind of information and register it immutably into a blockchain. The logistics and supply chain industries require large amounts of data to be registered and shared with precise transparency and trust among many parties. Blockchain and NFTs can help to create unique identifiers for each parcel or item, making them fully traceable in real-time. \\n\\nAn Indian company called [KoineArth](https://www.koinearth.com/) recently released MarketsN, an NFT-as-a-service platform for supply chain management. According to their website, MarketsN “enables you to create a digital twin of your value chain with just a few clicks creating a cost advantage over competitors who rely on traditional IT.” \\n\\nOur company, [EOS Costa Rica](https://eoscostarica.io/), is currently developing a solution for the health industry. It will trace supplies using NFTs and EOSIO blockchain technology by registering identifiers into the network. The solution offers better visibility and trust across its supply chain, keeping track of existing inventory in real-time. It’s currently under development, and we hope to share further details shortly. \\n\\n### 5. NFTs for Digital Identity: \\n\\nBlockchain has [demostrated its potential](https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Self-Sovereign-Identity-The-Future-of-Identity-Self-Sovereignity-Digital-Wallets-and-Blockchain.pdf) as a powerful technology to register and secure digital identities. Now, NFTs can help tokenize identities to expand their use cases. For instance, think of proofs of membership to a club or event. Members can be able to own their digital identity cards and keep their information intact. They may disclose their identity to enter or access a VIP section while maintaining their privacy. \\n\\nAlso, NFTs can become the future of national ID cards. Everyone will own their private information and will be able to manage what data to share and what data to keep confidential while connected to a blockchain ecosystem that can verify its authenticity. \\n\\n### 6. NFTs for Finance and Fundraising:\\n\\nWith the advancements of DeFi (decentralized finance), NFTs can also see new opportunities to reach more users. For example, NFTs can help collateralize tangible assets by tokenizing them into the blockchain. It seems that Uniswap, a well-known DEX (decentralized exchange), will start using NFTs as proof of liquidity. \\n\\nMoreover, the popularity of NFTs among users buying and collecting them may represent new opportunities for crowdfunding organizations or activities. For instance, our team is working on [gGoods](http://ggoods.io/), a platform that enables non-profits to create their NFTs and making them available on a marketplace to fundraise their operations. Then, the patrons may use their NFTs as in-game assets to play games or on other apps such as AR cameras or geolocation maps. It’s currently under development but will launch officially soon. \\n\\n## Final Takeaways\\n\\nNFTs have proved their potential to seamlessly register data unique to a digital asset into a blockchain and offer an outstanding user experience. Apart from the prevalent examples in the art world, such as Beeple’s “Everyday – The First 5000 Days,” there are relevant use cases in games, collectibles, and creating virtual worlds. \\n\\nHowever, there are still many exciting opportunities in the corporate and enterprise space to be explored. For instance, NFTs can transform how we register legal documents, sell and buy real estate, or file patents and intellectual property. Also, NFTs represent a great way to keep track of inventory and supply chain processes in real-time, manage digital identities on the blockchain, and play a role in financial transactions. Only time will tell how NFTs will transform life as we know it.\\n\\n## Contact Us for More Information About Blockchain\\n\\nEOS Costa Rica operates since 2018.

Was it Space Invaders, Super Mario Bros. on a NES, or The Sims? Either way, most likely you’ve played video games more than once, be it on a console, PC, or a mobile phone between meetings or while queueing at the bank. Video games have kept us busy during leisure times and, most importantly, they’ve become part of our lives. \\n\\nAccording to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/video-game-industry-120-billion-future-innovation-2019-9), “video games are more than just a booming entertainment business — they\'re reshaping the way we interact with the world.” Experts forecast that by 2022, the gaming industry will produce $196 billion in revenue. Currently, there are [2.5 billion gamers in the world](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/16/2063071/0/en/3-5-Billion-Gamers-Globally-by-2024-but-Cloud-Gaming-Must-Evaluate-Business-Models-in-Order-to-Survive.html), which suggests that 1 in 3 people play video games, and it might reach 3.5 million by 2024–more than half of the total population.\\n\\nOne of the cornerstones of the gaming industry is how revolutionary it has become, welcoming the most advanced technologies and innovations that include virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), and now, blockchain. \\n\\n<!--truncate-->\\n\\n## What Is Blockchain?\\n\\nBlockchain is one of the new technologies part of the industry 4.0 and a foundational technology that can integrate into countless use cases. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger shared among a network of computers or “nodes” to securely and immutably register data. The data is cryptographically stored and since there is no single point of failure, a blockchain is resistant to cyber attacks or hacking attempts. \\n\\nAdditionally, blockchain adds new layers of transparency, offering complete traceability of transactions that cannot be altered. Blockchain also enables the deployment of smart contracts, which are computer codes that can execute autonomously and automatically when meeting the contract’s requirements, allowing more efficient transactions and cutting expenses related to transaction processing. \\n\\nTo read more about blockchain technology, [go here](https://eoscostarica.io/blog/what-is-blockchain).\\n\\n![Leveling Up the Gaming Industry with Blockchain](/img/blog/gaming/gaming-photo.jpg)\\n\\n## How Blockchain Impacts Video Games?\\n\\n### 1. A Fairer Industry and Ecosystem\\n\\nThe gaming industry involves many stakeholders. From game developers, to game publishers that oversee how a game reaches gamers. However, across this value chain, there are big opportunities for technologies like blockchain. Blockchain’s capabilities have shown that it can improve trust and transparency when registering sensitive information and transactions.\\n\\nFor instance, [Microsoft XBox is reducing the operational costs](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/advisory/how-blockchain-helped-a-gaming-platform-become-a-game-changer) of processing payments for creators by deploying smart contracts. Smart contracts enable Microsoft Xbox to encode game creators’ IP rights, calculate royalties efficiently and transparently, and automate payment processing. \\n\\nAnother cool example is what [pixEOS](https://pixeos.io/) is doing. The project deploys EOSIO technology and features an art gallery, a hub to experiment with user interfaces, and an avatar creator. It encourages gamification and uses blockchain-based tokens to interact with the platform. \\n\\nMoreover, blockchain allows users to interact with decentralized, open-source gaming servers and claim ownership on their content. With this technology, there are countless possibilities to grow fair ecosystems in which content creators and gamers can lead their experience.\\n\\n### 2. Better Digital Assets and Collectibles Management\\n\\nBlockchain technology allows the creation, management, and verification of digital assets. It enables ownership of these assets by anchoring it to a verified account. The owner can then either collect, trade, or sell the asset by deploying the same technology. What’s interesting about digital assets in games is that gamers need these scarce items to complete missions or stand out. Either owning a better gun at any shooter, a special-edition skin to look fly in Fortnite, or just collecting art pieces in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, in-game items play a big part in the gaming experience.\\n\\nHowever, blockchain comes to solve issues such as the lack of accountability and transparency when managing digital assets. Let’s remember these are virtual goods, so it’s easy for game creators to just mass-produce these items and the player has no way to know if theirs are unique or not. So, are these collectibles actually as “special” as we want to think they are?\\n\\nSuch is the use of [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/nonfungible-tokens/#what-can-a-nft-represent). NFTs are unique, rare, and indivisible cryptographic tokens representing crypto-collectibles, digital artwork, tickets to an event, or in-game items, among others. Perhaps the most known example of NFTs in gaming is [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), a game in which you can collect and breed digital cats. The platform deploys NFTs where each token has distinctive “cattributes,” thus making each token special. When breeding cats with different features, the offspring would be rare and hence more exclusive than others. \\n\\nAnother great use case of blockchain is trading or selling these in-game assets outside of a game ecosystem. Game creators often work on enclosed ecosystems where trading outside of their virtual world is hard or impossible. This limitation has led to the creation of grey markets outside of their game environments. For example, blockchain can enable game developers and publishers to embed rules into their digital assets and try to build a profitable market that is better organized and safer for gamers. \\n\\nOn the other hand, [Mythical Games](https://mythical.games/) is a games developer that deploys EOSIO blockchain technology. They recently released a private beta for [Blankos](https://blankos.com/), a game that leverages a social MMO-based gaming experience where the player owns their digital toys. The player can then create minigames, hang out with friends, and participate in challenges. Blankos uses NFTs to guarantee ownership of the characters and virtual objects, and even encourages an in-game market. \\n\\nAdditionally, [Immutable](https://immutable.com/) offers a platform that allows game developers to deploy blockchain technology into their games. Games such as [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/), a digital trading card game, are currently using this platform. Also, leading video games company [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/) is [deploying NFTs](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/ubisoft-launches-blockchain-collectibles-based-on-rabbids-franchise/). The company launched [Rabbids Tokens](https://rabbidstoken.ubisoft.com/) to raise money for UNICEF through Rabbids tokens that can be traded like cards. \\n\\nMoreover, blockchain technology can enhance the gamers’ experience. [Anatol Hooper from CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-attracts-investors-to-blockchain-gaming) states that “NFT’s can be used to increase player engagement and improve the ARPPU (average revenue per paying user). Game publishers have been noticing that blockchain-enabled games produce much higher ARPPU metrics due to the greater perceived value by the user.” \\n\\n### 3. Improved Security for Gamers\\n\\nOne of the core features of blockchain technology is enabling an environment where two strangers on the internet can interact with each and make transactions in a safe and trusty way. Blockchain is practically unhackable, becoming the safest way to store value, since there is no single point of failure.\\n\\nFor example, IBM has been working on a [blockchain protocol for the gaming industry](https://www.coindesk.com/ibm-patent-blockchain-transaction-consensus-games). This protocol can be implemented in games with a large user base such as Call of Duty, Warzone, and Fortnite. This blockchain is set to facilitate smart contracts and move it to the gaming server if the gamers have enough computing power. Moreover, it will facilitate transactions between unknown players verified by the peers connected to the network.\\n\\n### 4. Faster Transaction Processing\\n\\nAs previously mentioned, blockchain can help create a haven for transacting collectibles, tokens, and other digital assets among players. However, game developers must also ensure that the experience of exchanging these assets is as streamlined as possible. \\n\\nBlockchain has [demonstrated its ability](https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/how-transactions-get-into-the-blockchain) to manage fast, secure transactions in trusty environments. The technology is capable of enabling authentication and automatization of transactions. These features can be replicated in the gaming industry and allow instant, cross-border payments without traditional methods restrictions. \\n\\nOn this line, a notable example is what [Ubisoft is doing along with Ultra](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ubisoft-might-be-the-first-major-games-company-to-geek-out-over-blockchain), a gaming platform that deploys EOSIO blockchain technology that can be described as Steam on a blockchain. This innovative application of blockchain for gaming can enable users new groundbreaking features such as earning digital currency, buying games online and then reselling them among their peers. \\n\\nMoreover, [Upland](https://www.upland.me/) offers an in-game economy that maps the real world and deploys blockchain and NFTs. Recently, [Upland launched](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124104/0/en/Upland-Launches-First-Virtual-Asset-Trading-of-NFTs-for-Fiat-in-Partnership-with-Second-Life-s-Payment-Network-Tilia-Pay.html) the first virtual asset trading platform of NFTs for fiat money where players can put their digital properties on sale and withdraw USD directly to their personal account.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWe’re currently living a transformational time for the video games. It is shaping the future and innovating day by day. To no surprise, they are naturally implementing new technologies and blockchain is added to the equation. \\n\\nThere currently is an initiative called the [Blockchain Game Alliance](https://blockchaingamealliance.org/) committed to promoting blockchain within the game industry with dozens of members worldwide. \\n\\nBlockchain in video games is an exciting endeavor that is only getting started. From creating a fairer industry in which multiple stakeholders can interact in a safe environment to enhancing the overall gaming experience with NFTs and collectibles; blockchain is changing the rules of the game for the industry, and will continue to do so in the upcoming years!\\n\\n\\n## **Contact Us for More Information About Open-Source Blockchain**\\n\\n[EOS Costa Rica](https://eoscostarica.io/) operates since 2018.

A Quick Guide","permalink":"/blog/what-is-blockchain"}},"content":"![Why Get Involved in Open Source ](/img/blog/eos-rate/eos-rate.jpg)\\n\\n## **What is the EOS Mainnet?**\\n\\nIf you belong to the EOSIO community – or have read something about the EOSIO blockchain – **you might have heard of the EOS Mainnet.** The EOS Mainnet is the main network of the EOSIO blockchain’s platform where transactions take place. Also, if you’re reading this, it’s highly probable that you know the terminology of blockchain. Otherwise, [check this article out in the first place](https://eoscostarica.io/what-is-blockchain)!\\n\\nFurther, the EOSIO protocol uses a consensus mechanism known as “Delegated Proof-of-Stake” (DPoS), developed by Daniel Larimer. DPoS in EOSIO uses an election process where EOS token holders vote for the Block Producers (BPs) they think are the most qualified to be the custodians of the network. The EOS Mainnet runs with the twenty-one BPs that obtain the most votes.\\n\\nSo, the DPoS mechanism requires these twenty-one elected nodes to produce the blocks, and, in exchange, they can receive rewards. One of the underlying opportunities of EOSIO by using DPoS is the ability to scale. Hence, DPoS allows Block Producers to reach consensus faster than traditional PoW (Proof-of-Work) or PoS (Proof-of-Stake) mechanisms. For instance, this enables EOS nodes to validate up to 4,000 transactions per second, [in comparison to Ethereum that can reach 15](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/ethereum-vs-eos-ultimate-comparison-guide).\\n\\n<!--truncate-->\\n\\n## With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility\\n\\nNonetheless, people in the EOS community claim that both DPoS and the EOS Mainnet may be having some drawbacks, including [more centralization in a network that’s supposed to be decentralized](https://coincentral.com/what-is-an-eos-delegate). For example, in one case, [some accounts were frozen by BPs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-block-producers-freeze-user-funds-to-prevent-theft-resulting-in-twitter-backlash), which raised people’s eyebrows in the community. Also, there have been some disagreements associated with [performance degradation in the network](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-network-suffering-from-degraded-performance-says-coinbase).\\n\\nConsequently, token holders who elect the twenty-one nodes can only trust the transparency and democracy of the EOS Mainnet. Thus, these BPs are the ones who must protect and keep the mainnet up and running in the best interests of the voting community.\\n\\nAs of now, it’s only possible to keep track of [rankings according to votes by token holders](https://bloks.io/). However, the weight of token holders’ votes is determined by the number of EOS tokens they possess, meaning that token holders with more EOS can cast a more weighted vote for the BPs they want to endorse. In other words, those who have fewer EOS tokens may seem underrepresented. So, the importance of maintaining a transparent and trustworthy election process in the EOS Mainnet is what brought to life the idea of the open-source app called [**EOS Rate**](https://eosrate.io).\\n\\n## What Is EOS Rate?\\n\\n\\n[**EOS Rate**](https://eosrate.io) is an open-source, decentralized app (Dapp) built by a team of developers in Costa Rica. It allows EOS token holders to access a rating system and voting portal for BPs and Proxies, making it easier for the token holders to make an informed decision.\\n\\nMoreover, EOS Rate intends to gather global ratings to help capture collective opinion, or “wisdom of the crowd,” and measure if the voting patterns reflect voter sentiment. Then, the Dapp generates profile pages of the BPs, using a radial component called “LEAF” (Liquid EOS Attribute Factors) to help the users visually compare the most relevant qualitative attributes of BPs.\\n\\nSo, to submit ratings, the token holders must sign in with their EOS wallet, making the voting process more secure and transparent. This means that one account can only represent one rating submission per BP. Then, the ratings are securely stored in the EOS blockchain to guarantee the immutability of the ratings.\\n\\nIn addition, token holders can submit their rating in EOS Rate using five distinct categories:\\n\\n*   **Transparency:** Compliance with disclosure of ownership, complete bp.json, use of rewards, and financial stats.\\n*   **Infrastructure:** Stability and reliability of the EOS infrastructure.\\n*   **Trustiness:** Collaboration and reputation among the EOS community.\\n*   **Community:** Community value creation through education and promoting talks, chats, hackathons, conferences, seminars, developer spaces, and other useful content.\\n*   **Development:** Technical know-how and usage of open-source software, scripts, frameworks, wallets, voting portals, metrics, etc.\\n\\n\\nIn particular, once a token holder submits his or her ratings, the total of the ratings will be displayed as radial graphs. So, the process of EOS Rate would be something like this:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/eos-rate/EOS-Rate-Infographic.jpg)\\n\\n## Try the Beta Version\\n\\nWe are looking for token holders who want to become beta testers! Access the portal through [this link](https://eosrate.io), sign in using your EOS wallet, and start rating BPs and Proxies!\\n\\nEOS Rate beta version is currently running in [Jungle Testnet](https://jungletestnet.io/) and ratings are exclusive for the BPs using this testnet.\\n\\nMoreover, we tried to make the process as straightforward as possible for better usability and findability. So, if you have any questions or observations during your testing, please let us know through our [Telegram group](https://t.me/eoscr) or directly to our email: [bp@edenia.com](mailto:bp@edenia.com).\\n\\n[Try EOS Rate](https://eosrate.io/)\\n\\n## Developing an Open-Source App for the EOS Mainnet\\n\\nSo, what is it like to develop an open-source app? First, an open-source project is an initiative built by the community and for the community. Thus, when participating in an open-source app, there is an implicit agreement to use its source code, design documents, and other original content freely.\\n\\nMoreover, open-source projects usually need the participation of people from many backgrounds, including software devs, UX and visual designers, communications professionals, among others. As a result, people who cooperate in a project may receive several perks, such as networking opportunities or learning new skills. So, for more information on open-source projects, [read this blog post](https://eoscostarica.io/getting-involved-in-an-open-source-project).\\n\\nXavier Fernández, the tech lead of EOS Rate, says about the experience of developing this open-source dapp: “I’m excited to see new developers work with EOSIO and discover how powerful the technology is.”\\n\\nIn conclusion, EOS Rate is an open-source app built on the public Mainnet to encourage token holders to make a more informed vote. The team’s vision is to deploy blockchain technology to increase democracy and transparency within the platform’s network.\\n\\n## **Contact Us for More Information About Open-Source Blockchain**\\n\\n[EOS Costa Rica](https://eoscostarica.io/) operates since 2018.

But first… what is blockchain? \\n\\nA blockchain is a registry of data that acts as a decentralized ledger shared among various computers or “nodes” to reliably and securely record transactions. So, the information of the transactions will register into a blockchain as “blocks” of data. Then, these blocks will connect chronologically, forming some kind of “chain.” \\n\\nThe security and trustworthiness of this technology lean mostly on its decentralization attributes. Each one of the nodes in a network contains a copy of this ledger. The nodes must verify and validate each transaction before it appends to the chain. \\n\\nAlso, a user can’t erase or alter any record in a blockchain. In other words, a blockchain will only grow in size. So, to amend a record, a new transaction must be validated and added to the chain.\\n\\nEach block must include the following information:\\n\\n*   Information about the transactions. For example, date, time, and an amount.\\n*   Information about who is participating in the transaction. For instance, users or digital identities. \\n*   Distinctive information about the block, known as “hash,” which cannot be altered. A “hash” is a code created by a mathematical function that transforms data with variable lengths into a line of code with a specific length. \\n\\n**(TL;DR at the end of the article).**\\n\\n<!--truncate-->\\n\\n## **How a Blockchain Works?**\\n\\nTo better understand how a blockchain works, we can compare these decentralized ledgers to a domino game where the players are the nodes. This means that all the players have visibility on what happens on the board. Also, the nodes are aware that there is a set of rules for the game. For instance, a person cannot skip a turn or play a domino tile where it doesn’t match, because the other players in charge of validation will eventually draw it back. In fact, that’s the responsibility of the nodes in a network.\\n\\n![How does blockchain work](/img/blog/what-is-blockchain/How-blockchain-works.jpeg)\\n\\nLikewise, blockchain technology allows decentralized registries of data. In particular, blockchain may enable the automatic and autonomous execution of transactions, meaning that now the users can manage their transactions directly and securely, cutting the middleman. How? The nodes must verify that everyone around the board (either anonymously or with know identities) plays by the rules. This is known as “consensus.” \\n\\nFor example, a logistics company may choose to assign the computer nodes to organizations across the supply chain, including tax authorities, ports, suppliers, and wholesalers. So, this will most likely increase trust among the parties because now all of them can validate each transaction and have visibility throughout the logistics process.\\n\\nAdditionally, when deploying blockchain, users can be anonymous or use a pseudonym. If so, the registries (the blocks) will remain cyphered to protect their privacy and security. Therefore, any transaction request that they make, be it, for example, sending cryptocurrencies, logging an accounting entry, or adding information to a medical record, must be verified and validated by the nodes. \\n\\n![How does blockchain work](/img/blog/what-is-blockchain/how-does-blockchain-work.png)\\n\\nBack to the domino example, let’s say someone adds a new tile (a Block Producer) and, at the same time, the rest of the players close their eyes to not see who’s playing. At the end of the turn, all the players open their eyes to validate the new tile.\\n\\nSubsequently, after the majority of the players agree the transaction was valid, the block appends to the chain. At this point, the block will remain immutable and can no longer be changed or removed from the chain. Thus, the block is irreversible, evading any fraud or unauthorized changes.\\n\\nIn summation, being a decentralized network adds layers of security to a blockchain. Additionally, each block is linked to its predecessor by a unique code known as a “hash.” This hash code represents the data in the block. The hash is fundamental for traceability purposes and for preventing cyberattacks. Accordingly, a hacker who’s trying to modify data in a blockchain must try to hack all the hash codes in a chain, making it nearly impossible.\\n\\nIn other words, back to the domino example, this might be a way to verify that the number in the tiles in a chain match following a logic order.\\n\\n## Beyond Blockchain\\n\\nMoreover, blockchain is well known for cryptocurrencies. However, blockchain is disrupting many industries worldwide. Blockchain platforms such as EOSIO, known for its flexibility and scalability, are using smart contracts to leverage the use of blockchain for enterprise solutions.\\n\\nIn particular, smart contracts are codes programmed to execute automatically and autonomously when the requirements are met. For example, let’s imagine two people are playing coin toss. They agree that if it lands heads, person A must pay person B $100\\\\. But, if it lands tails, person B must pay person A the same amount. There are no questions asked, as there are only two possible outcomes and they both have visibility of the truth. Hence, the same happens with a smart contract in a blockchain.\\n\\nSome use cases of blockchain are:\\n\\n*   **Enterprise data solutions:** Chile’s [Comisión Nacional de Energía](https://energiaabierta.cl/blockchain/que-es-blockchain/) (National Energy Commission) launched a blockchain-based platform to keep registries of costs and price data.\\n*   **Food traceability:** Walmart started using blockchain to track perishable goods across the supply chain.

By its nature, companies that produce or sell goods must manage large networks of individuals and organizations to supply their operations and run logistics processes. Blockchain – a technology part of industry 4.0 – may transform these daily activities. So, before going more in-depth on how to deploy blockchain in logistics, let’s take a look at this industry.\\n\\nLogistics is the management of the flow of material things such as inventory or finished goods from one point to another. It involves a very complex operation that requires multiple people and entities to play a part in its handling, production, packaging, transportation, tax management, warehousing, insurance, security, and delivery to customers. \\n\\nOverall, the complexity of logistics represents a very fertile ground of opportunities for blockchain. Blockchain is a technology with a list of capabilities that could solve many issues along the process. These include traceability and automatization of transactions. But, what exactly is blockchain?\\n\\n**(TL;DR at the end of the article).**\\n\\n<!--truncate-->\\n\\n## **What Is Blockchain?**\\n\\nA [blockchain consists of an immutable record of data](https://eoscostarica.io/blog/what-is-blockchain) that acts as a decentralized ledger shared by a cluster of computers or “nodes,” which securely registers transactions in “blocks” of data. The nodes that participate in the network will validate the transaction through a consensus mechanism. Once they approve the transaction, the block appends to the blockchain. \\n\\nTo sum up, the immutability features of blockchain guarantee that no person can manipulate the data. This data is stored as an encrypted sequence of transactions that can be tracked nearly in real-time. Blockchain allows a user to track all these transactions, meaning it becomes a valuable feature to trace things across a logistics chain. \\n\\nMoreover, blockchain offers other useful functionalities to the logistics industry, such as the ability to create and execute smart contracts. Using smart contracts may help, for instance, easily display in near real-time the exact location of a parcel and the identity of who authorized its freight. A smart contract is a code that can be executed automatically and autonomously when the agreed terms are met. For example, [Walmart Canada](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3454336/walmart-launches-world-s-largest-blockchain-based-freight-and-payment-network.html?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=79697372&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--W52pX5g6pP-QMxqrb4PPzAPPdkQcN06hNhlcps8fx1Jk6AXz3i137XT1S8az4NDl0ntkiSyPn7Wn7lo8nF5LScW3_Yw&_hsmi=79697372) recently launched a blockchain-based platform with freight tracking and payment processing to improve the supply chain to its more than 400 retail stores.\\n\\n## **How a Blockchain Works?**\\n\\nTo start a transaction (of data), a user must request the validation of the nodes in the network. The nodes will then validate and approve a transaction depending on values such as available funds or permissions to execute a transaction, for instance. Then, the transaction data is stored in a block of data.\\n\\nOnce the nodes approve the transaction, this block of data appends to the blockchain and generates a “hash” code, which is a unique ID. A hash is calculated by an algorithm that transforms information of variable lengths into a code of specific length. \\n\\nConsequently, the block of data and, therefore, the transaction will remain immutably registered in the blockchain; hence the blocks of data cannot be deleted or altered. This means that to change any record, a user must request a new transaction. The chain cannot be reduced in size; it can only grow by adding new blocks of data to amend past transactions. \\n\\n![How Blockchain Works ](/img/blog/logistics/how-blockhain-works.png)\\n\\n## **Blockchain in Logistics: What Can This Technology Offer?**\\n\\nBy deploying blockchain technology, companies may solve many of the challenges and hurdles across supply chains. Managing one of these chains is very complex and involves many stakeholders throughout the flow of goods. Consequently, this might create data silos and insufficient transparency, hence lower levels of trust among organizations.\\n\\nIn short, how can blockchain technology significantly change the logistics industry?\\n\\n### **1\\\\. Increasing Transparency and Traceability:**\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, logistics processes often involve a large number of stakeholders. From factories, customs personnel, and carriers, to banks and insurance companies. Unstandardized procedures and low levels of transparency might undoubtedly result in a lack of trust and hence causing friction among parties. \\n\\nAlternatively, blockchain technology can help increase transparency by authorizing key users of the stakeholders so they can have visibility throughout the whole process. This means that a blockchain-based application may allow anyone involved and authorized to view where a package is, in near real-time, from leaving the factory and until reaching its destination. \\n\\nAdditionally, the technology offers traceability across the value chain. This visibility can also be aimed at final customers who can reliably view the process of the goods they buy. For example, the mining and gemstones trading company [De Beers](https://www.debeersgroup.com/media/company-news) announced that it would start using blockchain for tracking stones along the value chain. This will likely impact a market where consumers are turning their heads towards ethical purchasing and are becoming more aware of [issues such as Blood Diamonds](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/03/14/how-blockchain-could-end-the-trade-in-blood-diamonds-an-incredible-use-case-everyone-should-read/#22a75fce387d).\\n\\n![Supply-chain-infographic](/img/blog/logistics/Supply-chain-infographic.png)\\n\\n### **2\\\\. Leaner and More Optimized Logistics Process:**\\n\\nOne of the main problems in logistics is precisely the fact that the process depends on several – if not dozens – different stakeholders. It’s highly probable that all these organizations and entities have their platforms and systems, meaning that technology adoption will most likely be disparate among them. \\n\\nTo improve the flow of goods, the value chain must be unfragmented and optimized. Blockchain technology may solve this by offering a decentralized solution. By using a distributed ledger, all these stakeholders can better trust the system and therefore increase lean communication and processing of packages. In an industry where people still use pen and paper, deploying this technology may certainly go a long way. \\n\\nFor example, logistics corporation Maersk and IBM formed a joint venture to develop [TradeLens](https://www.tradelens.com/), a global supply blockchain-based solution to track containers. To date, the platform has [processed millions of containers worldwide](https://cointelegraph.com/news/standard-chartered-joins-ibm-and-maersks-blockchain-shipping-platform) and captures thousands of documents weekly.\\n\\n### **3\\\\. Improved Efficiency and Cost Savings**\\n\\nFurthermore, blockchain’s ability to deploy smart contracts can enhance logistics and help cut costs. For instance, smart contracts can automate processes such as customs duties, payment processing, or executing insurance. Consequently, companies may lower costs related to paper filing or interacting with middlemen. \\n\\nFor example, [Cloud Logistics](https://www.gocloudlogistics.com/) is a company that provides blockchain supply chain solutions. This platform offers the possibility to automate the freight auditing process and to leverage data to create future savings. \\n\\nOverall, there is currently a blue ocean of opportunities for blockchain technology to set sail.\\n\\n## **Contact Us for More Information About Blockchain in Logistics.**\\n\\n[EOS Costa Rica](https://eoscostarica.io/) operates since 2018\\\\.

[Blockchain is an immutable and decentralized record of data](https://eoscostarica.io/blog/what-is-blockchain) that offers traceability and automatization of transactions. Specifically, blockchain can leverage logistics and supply chain by:\\n\\n1.  **Increasing transparency and traceability:** Involving a large number of stakeholders with unstandardized procedures and low levels of transparency can lead to a lack of trust and friction among parties. Blockchain allows users to grant authorizations to have complete visibility across the process, facilitating traceability of goods (from the factory to its destination).\\n2.  **Leaner and more optimized logistics process:** When the process relies on multiple stakeholders, technology adoption will most likely be disparate. Blockchain can provide an unfragmented and streamlined platform that replaces pen and paper and increase lean communication and processing of packages.\\n3.  **Improved efficiency and cost savings:** By deploying smart contracts, blockchain can help cut costs automating processes related to paper filing and interacting with middlemen."},{"id":"open-source","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/open-source","editUrl":"https://github.com/eoscostarica/eoscostarica.io/edit/master/website/blog/blog/2020-01-27-open-source.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-01-27-open-source.md","title":"Why Get Involved in an Open-Source Project?","description":"Why Get Involved in Open Source","date":"2020-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 27, 2020","tags":[{"label":"eosio","permalink":"/blog/tags/eosio"},{"label":"blockchain","permalink":"/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"software development","permalink":"/blog/tags/software-development"}],"readingTime":4.185,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Diego Rojas","title":"Content Strategist","url":"https://twitter.com/ldrojas","imageURL":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/29232417?s=400&u=032f18555bd97e3d90f3ddfb5b2dc72dfcf0d11b&v=4"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Blockchain in Logistics - Transforming an Industry","permalink":"/blog/blockchain-logistics"},"nextItem":{"title":"Blockchain in Agriculture: Growing Better Systems","permalink":"/blog/blockchain-in-agriculture"}},"content":"![Why Get Involved in Open Source ](/img/blog/open-source/why-open-source.jpg)\\n\\n## What Is An Open-Source Project?\\n\\nParticipating in an open-source project may bring you several perks, and it won’t necessarily mean immediate compensation. An open-source project is built by the community and for the community. There is an implicit agreement to use the source code, design documents, and original content of the product freely. So, why get involved in an open-source project?\\n\\nPeople from many backgrounds can participate in open-source projects, including software devs, UX and visual designers, communications professionals, among others. There are countless reasons why people choose to cooperate in an open-source project, and those include:\\n\\n<!--truncate-->\\n\\n1.  **I want to support a project in which I believe:** For some, supporting what they think is the right cause may be enough to get involved in an open-source project. The motivations behind this may be altruistic or simply because they want to give back to a community that supported them in the past.\\n2.  **I’m looking for networking opportunities:** Participating in an open-source project means joining an exciting community of professionals in many areas of knowledge. It can become an excellent chance for networking with members of this community, which may lead to new business opportunities in the future.\\n3.  **I want to learn new skills:** Contributing to an open-source project can help you acquire new knowledge. An open-source project usually groups people willing to collaborate across the whole process. Consequently, you won’t need to be an expert to get involved! You may find a task to do based on your level of experience. For instance, a good starting point is to create or improve documentation on the process. Later you can think about experimenting with your first pull request.\\n4.  **I want to be part of something relevant: **Being part of an open-source initiative may be both rewarding and an excellent way to join a community with similar interests to yours.\\n5.  **I’m looking for career opportunities: **Participating in an open-source community may open the doors to new recruiting opportunities, or at the very least, help you gather more experience to enrich your CV and repository. For example, we at EOS Costa Rica have employed people that started working with open-source initiatives and are now working with international scope projects.\\n6.  **I’m seeking external rewards: **On many occasions, those who contribute to open-source projects are looking for different types of rewards apart from wages. For instance, it can be a way to obtain access to a specific tool or software that the community works with or to receive future rewards. You must only have to play your cards right.\\n7.  Lastly, **contributing to open-source projects is fun!** For those who enjoy coding, this might be an exciting and worthwhile opportunity. Also, many open-source communities invite contributors to events or other group activities.\\n\\n## Why Get Involved in Our Open-Source Project?\\n\\nWe currently have an open-source project on our Github that is related to blockchain technology. EOS Rate is a decentralized app that will allow EOS token holders to rate [Block Producers](https://eoscostarica.io/enterprise-blockchain-solutions/transparency/) easily. These ratings may help increase transparency and trust within the EOSIO network. Please take a look at it on [our Github here](https://github.com/eoscostarica/eos-rate).\\n\\nAll in all, if you’ve wanted to get involved in a blockchain-related project, this may be your chance. We’re seeking developers with experience using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and knowledge on Javascript and C++ to help code smart contracts.\\n\\n[EOSIO protocol](https://eos.io/) appeared as a third-generation blockchain technology from a white paper published by the company Block.one. In essence, EOSIO is a decentralized blockchain infrastructure that emulates the attributes of computer hardware, including CPU, RAM, and memory. Thus, it means that the platform can be customized for many uses cases, including the private and public sectors, leading the processing of applications seamlessly and securely.\\n\\n[Block.one closed an ICO](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-eos) (initial coin offering) in June 2018, raising more than US$4 billion by selling 1 billion tokens. Such investment is living proof of the network’s potential to generate impact and disruption in the blockchain ecosystem.\\n\\n### Why Is It Important to Rate EOSIO Block Producers?\\n\\nEOSIO protocol uses a unique consensus mechanism known as “Delegated Proof of Stake” (DPoS). Therefore, it requires the election of 21 nodes that will remain as Block Producers. These Block Producers are the [custodians of the EOSIO network](https://eos.io/faq/what-are-block-producers/), and they are responsible for validating and verifying transactions. EOS token-holders vote to elect the custodians.\\n\\nWe believe in the importance of rating Block Producers and candidates to measure whether the sentiment of the community is genuinely reflected in voting patterns to boost transparency in the network.\\n\\n## **Contact Us for More Information About Open-Source Blockchain**\\n\\n[EOS Costa Rica](https://eoscostarica.io/) operates since 2018.

In 2030, the demand for food is expected to [increase by 35%](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/here-s-how-we-can-use-agriculture-to-fight-climate-change). This would require more efficient production systems to meet the needs of a growing population. The sector has experienced many changes with the rise of new technologies, and there is still a lot of opportunities to implement innovative solutions that go hand in hand with Industry 4.0.\\n\\nFor instance, blockchain technology. A [blockchain is a large record of data](https://eoscostarica.io/blog/what-is-blockchain/) that resembles a ledger that is shared among various users or nodes to securely register immutable transactions.\\n\\nThere are numerous use cases of this technology for its traceability and cost-efficiency capabilities. Over the years, many blockchain platforms have been developed and the protocol known as [EOSIO](https://eos.io/) has stood up because of its versatility and smart contracts execution capacity.\\n\\n<!--truncate-->\\n\\n## Some Possible Outcomes When Deploying Blockchain in Agriculture\\n\\n### 1. It increases efficiency and traceability across the production chain:\\n\\nBlockchain may solve information management problems in real-time across the production and supply chains of agricultural products. As previously mentioned, a blockchain provides an immutable and transparent registry of data. This registry represents a more efficient, seamless, and easy-to-use alternative to monitor information of the process and improve traceability across the supply chain.\\n\\nAlso, deploying this technology allows keeping precise records of information about the origin of the products, production date, and details about the producer. Blockchain increases security and trustiness among parties, which may become valuable when exporting products. For instance, blockchain can rapidly help when recalling products in the case of a sanitary alert or to maintain traceability of the use of agrochemicals or fertilizers.\\n\\nItalian food company [Barilla is implementing blockchain](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2019/09/24/Blockchain-technology-is-improving-food-traceability) to guarantee the origin, quality of the product and raw materials, and to certify the freshness of basil used in some of their products. Additionally, [Walmart](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/walmart-is-betting-on-the-blockchain-to-improve-food-safety/) started implementing blockchain to digitize the traceability of perishable goods across the supply chain, thus helping sanitary authorities to react faster in case of identifying poisoning in a batch of products.\\n\\n![Agriculture-infographic](/img/blog/agriculture/agriculture-diagram.png)\\n\\n### 2. It improves production processes:\\n\\nTechnology has a positive impact on farming efficiency and productivity. For example, data gathered by sensors can be stored in a blockchain and used for specific actions. Measurable data include the temperature of the soil, the use of agrochemicals or fertilizer, water availability, and weather conditions\\n\\nBy having a clearer picture of usually unpredictable weather conditions, farmers can be prepared with anticipation to help them increase the survival of crops, improve pricing tactics, and therefore influence employment in the sector.\\n\\n### 3. It increases transparency for final consumers:\\n\\nThere is a growing demand for consumers to know the origin of the products they buy. This has opened a window of opportunity for blockchain technology. In a highly competitive field such as farming commodities (coffee, rice, beans), final consumers value access to information about the production process, to whom they are buying, and the overall quality of the product.\\n\\nFor instance, supermarket chain [Carrefour and Nestlé](https://www.nestle.com/media/news/carrefour-consumers-blockchain-mousline-puree-france) have partnered to implement blockchain into a purée brand in France. By using their smartphone, consumers can scan a QR code in the packaging and access to traceability information from production to the store, including the date of production, quality control parameters, storage times, and location of warehouses. Carrefour also started [implementing blockchain](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-carrefour-blockchain/carrefour-says-blockchain-tracking-boosting-sales-of-some-products-idUSKCN1T42A5) for other products such as meat, milk, and fruits.\\n\\n### 4. It improves the management of farm finances:\\n\\nManaging financial, accounting, and administrative information may be challenging for the agricultural sector. This may also carry difficulties when defining competitive prices for the products. By implementing blockchain, the management process of this data can be more transparent and accessible, as well as efficient and in real-time. The capabilities of blockchain to keep immutable registries may become an ally of farmers.\\n\\n\\n## Contact Us for More Information About Blockchain\\n\\nEOS Costa Rica operates since 2018.
