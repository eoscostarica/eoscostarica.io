                          Costa Rica has shores in both the Pacific and Atlantic
                          oceans and connects three submarine fiber optic cables –
                          ARCOS-1, MAYA-1, and Pan American Crossing (PAC) – that
                          provide the majority of the bandwidth in the country.
                          This interconnection provides real-time fail-over and
                          redundancy to our infrastructure. Costa Rica is part of
                          the six Central American nations interconnected via a
                          terrestrial fiber-optic network (REDCA). Additionally,
                          having direct connections to all upstream carriers
                          allows the country’s network to prevent single-point
                          failures.
