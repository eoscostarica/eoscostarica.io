                  EOS Costa Rica is part of a company with over 
                  three decades of developing innovative technologies. 
                  During the 80s, we launched the first BBS 
                  (bulletin board service) in the country, 
                  a precursor to the internet. Later on, 
                  the company shifted to educating new users 
                  on using the email and browsing the web! 
                  Then, we started offering internet infrastructure, 
                  hosting, and development services.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                  In 2013, we began providing infrastructure for public 
                  blockchain networks and learned first-hand 
                  how blockchains work. Then, in 2018 when 
                  the EOSIO protocol was launched, we investigated 
                  the advantages of this technology and started 
                  learning how to deploy it in the real world. 
                  Our presence grew during the genesis of the 
                  EOS Mainnet and will continue to be there 
                  throughout its growth.

                  We founded EOS Costa Rica two years ago — before the 
                  release of EOS… and quickly realized this was a marathon, 
                  not a sprint. We have experimented with different use 
                  cases for EOSIO blockchain technology, especially 
                  for enterprise use.

                  Our team offers an agile and 
                  lean approach to develop blockchain-based solutions 
                  that allow innovation departments to quickly and 
                  efficiently iterate and test proofs-of-concept with
                  a restricted budget and schedule. This ability enables
                  organizations to explore this technology’s benefits and 
                  experience its potential in a controlled environment.

                Our team specializes in the blockchain protocol
                <a href=" https://eos.io/" target='_blank'> EOSIO</a>, launched by 
                <a href=" https://block.one/" target='_blank' > block.one</a> in 2018, 
                as an open-source blockchain technology that deploys
                a consensus model known as Delegated Proof-of-Stake
                (DPoS). In DPoS, computers do not compete over 
                computational power to solve algorithms. 
                The following are some key features of EOSIO:

                </Box>
                <p >
                  EOSIO deploys the DPoS mechanism to achieve higher throughput
                  and efficiency, becoming the blockchain protocol with the
                  largest number of transactions per second at 4,000 on its
                  public blockchain. In contrast, the average in other
                  blockchain systems is 15-20 transactions per second.

                <p>
                  EOSIO enables adaptability for public and private networks
                  and can be customized according to the business requirements.
                  This blockchain technology offers low latency, meaning that
                  a user won't have to wait for a long time for a transaction
                  to be complete, ensuring a better user experience.

                <p>
                  EOSIO offers a flexible and favorable cost model that
                  eliminates the need for transaction fees. This model is
                  ideal for developers who seek a solution with low operation
                  costs and still offers an experience free to the user.

                <p>
                  The DPoS mechanism enables a sustainable blockchain
                  solution requiring less electricity to run nodes and
                  confirm transactions. For example, EOSIO is 66,000 times
                  more energy-efficient than Bitcoin and 17,000 times more
                  energy-efficient than Ethereum.

                <p>
                  Developers build smart contracts in EOSIO using C++,
                  a general-purpose programming language with widespread
                  adoption, thus eliminating the need to learn new languages
                  to begin deploying the technology. Also, there are many
                  learning resources available online and a dynamic support community.
