## Why Use Blockchain Technology?

It’s very likely that you already know what blockchain technology is, but it’s hard for you to explain it to your coworkers. Even so, you might be trying to convince your team to consider changing your registries from a centralized database to a decentralized blockchain network. (If you want to learn more about blockchain technology, read this article first.)

Blockchain can help improve transparency, efficiency, and security in an organization’s operations. Moreover, this technology’s immutability and traceability features can increase trust among different stakeholders, even if they’re outside the organization. However, indeed, blockchain technology is not for everyone – at least for now. 

Blockchain is a relatively new technology that still requires a significant amount of effort and resources to implement that can show benefits in the long term. So, we created an easy-to-use tool to help you analyze and weigh whether your organization will benefit from implementing it or if a centralized database would still get the job done.
