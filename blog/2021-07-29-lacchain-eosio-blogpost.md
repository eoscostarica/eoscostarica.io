## Get to Know LACChain EOSIO

TToday, the first testnet and website launch of [LACChain EOSIO](https://eosio.lacchain.net/), was announced, a significant step in the process of creating a regional EOSIO mainnet and the second multi-purpose public-permissioned network of LACChain. LACChain EOSIO is the result of a [partnership with EOS Argentina and LACChain](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-and-eosio-square-up-over-enterprise-blockchain-business-in-latin-america), an initiative led by IDB Lab (Innovation Laboratory of the Inter-American Development Bank Group), to work on an EOSIO-powered blockchain network in Latin America and the Caribbean. 

Our teams have been working on this open-source initiative to provide a fully functional network that will allow organizations and developers to test and build decentralized apps and infrastructure deploying the EOSIO blockchain protocol. The website offers access to a [block explorer](https://eosio-explorer.lacchain.net), network dashboard, and documentation to learn about LACChain EOSIO. LACChain EOSIO is “just the beginning of new EOSIO blockchain projects to come,” according to Xavier Fernández, Tech Lead of [EOS Costa Rica](https://eoscostarica.io/).

As of today, there are currently three projects deploying the LACChain EOSIO network testnet: [Lifebank](http://lifebank.io/), an open-source app to promote blood donations; [InmuTrust](https://inmutrust.com/), a blockchain-based software to improve transparency and traceability of vaccines; and [SMARTGATE](https://smartgate.tech/), a platform for in-out gate activity for the container industry. The three projects are from EOS Costa Rica, but it is now open to welcome projects from other developers globally. 

## What to Find in LACChain EOSIO?

The LACChain EOSIO network has been submitted with many simultaneous transactions to gauge its capacity and performance with positive results on the stress tests, reaching 2,157 transactions per second. Marco Allende, Tech Lead of [LACChain](https://www.lacchain.net/), stated that “with more than 100 nodes and 50 projects in the LACChain platform, EOSIO introduces new tools and features to LACChain’s users.”

Among the features of LACChain EOSIO, a user will find a [block explorer](https://eosio-explorer.lacchain.net), a network dashboard (part of [EOSIO Dashboard](https://lacchain.eosio.online/), announced last week), and technical documentation and resources to learn about the network and EOSIO blockchain technology. Further along the road, the team intends to work on an EOSIO MainNet. Developers and organizations will host and deploy system contracts based on the Proof-of-Authority (POA) consensus mechanism. 

EOSIO blockchain technology features an open-source protocol that offers high scalability, low block time latency rate, and Byzantine fault tolerance. EOSIO can deploy configurable smart contracts, making it a flexible protocol for various use cases that require custom governance and business logic. It offers the “speed and flexibility required to grow local economies and empower consumers to operate confidently across borders,” says Amanda Clark, Product Manager at [Block.one](https://b1.com/).
