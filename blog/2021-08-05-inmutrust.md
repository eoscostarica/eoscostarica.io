## Bringing Transparency and Visibility to the Vaccination Process

Today, blockchain development company [EOS Costa Rica](https://eoscostarica.io/) announced a collaboration with [LACChain](https://www.lacchain.net/) – an initiative led by [IDB Lab](https://bidlab.org/en), the Innovation Laboratory of Inter-American Development Bank Group (IDB) – to build and launch the proof-of-concept of [InmuTrust](https://inmutrust.com/). InmuTrust is a platform that deploys [EOSIO](https://eos.io/) blockchain technology to guarantee transparency and trust in the distribution of vaccines, concentrating on COVID-19 vaccines. 

“InmuTrust responded to an urgent need for a transparent distribution of vaccines where trust and visibility play key roles,” said Xavier Fernández, a co-founder and tech lead of EOS Costa Rica. “We started working on the proof-of-concept at the end of last year. It became a spearhead project for our team to aid the regional healthcare system through the use of blockchain technology given the demanding global situation.”

InmuTrust deploys blockchain technology to help track each vaccine from the manufacturer to its application, certifying that it did not have any irregularities during its supply chain process. It features several functionalities, including:
* EOSIO blockchain technology enables a user to manage permits, authorizations, and register control points and operative data to handle transactions properly and keep track of who accesses the information.
* It also enables complete visibility and traceability of the inventory of vaccines in real-time, including vaccine temperature history to ensure their proper storage. These data registries remain immutable, so that each transaction will be stored reliably. 
* The dashboard offers visualization of the geographic and demographic distribution of the vaccinates and vaccination procedures.
* InmuTrust deploys [NFTs](https://eoscostarica.io/blog/nfts-for-enterprise/) (non-fungible tokens) and offers integration with verifiable vaccination certificates stored in a blockchain.

The EOS Costa Rica and LACChain teams decided to build InmuTrust amid the COVID-19 pandemic after identifying potential issues when tracking the vaccines’ distribution regionally. Vaccines from different manufacturers have unique conditions regarding storage temperatures, expiration times, and handling, requiring precise traceability across logistics operations to safeguard their integrity. 

InmuTrust is the second collaboration project between EOS Costa Rica and LACChain to leverage EOSIO blockchain technology. Previously, it was announced the [release of the LACChain EOSIO testnet](https://eoscostarica.io/blog/lacchain-eosio-launch/). This network deploys a public-permissioned version of EOSIO within a testing environment in Latin America and the Caribbean. InmuTrust is one of the first projects to deploy the LACChain EOSIO network to host the platform.

“A user of InmuTrust will be able to access the full traceability of the logistics of vaccines across the globe and according to health entities' standards,” added  Edgar Fernández, a co-founder and business manager of EOS Costa Rica. “Now, we’re looking for government institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean that wish to secure transparent and reliable vaccination processes to safeguard the integrity of each dose.”
