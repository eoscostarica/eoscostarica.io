## About the Project

Edenia, also known as [EOS Costa Rica](https://eoscostarica.io/), is glad to announce our strategic collaboration with the team of [Proton](https://www.protonchain.com/), a blockchain developed by Metallicus. Proton was built to streamline on-chain payments processing, adding governance, network resources allocation, and rewards staking. For the past few months, our team has been working on an Affiliate Program (AP) feature for the [Proton wallet](https://www.protonchain.com/wallet), which launched today in the beta stage for selected countries.

Edenia brings together years of experience working in several blockchain networks and managing infrastructure with a keen eye for user experience and solving real-world problems through 4.0 technologies. Identified as EOS Costa Rica in the EOSIO community, our team has developed several dApps and projects for the ecosystem, such as:

<!--truncate-->

- [Antelope Tools](https://antelope.tools/): an open-source platform that allows users to visualize the rewards distribution along the EOS network to seek accountability and transparency.
- [EOS Rate](https://eosrate.io/): an open-source dApp that allows EOS token holders to access a rating system and voting portal for block producers and proxies in the EOS blockchain.
- [Developers Guide](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/): a compelling set of resources, tutorials, tools, and links to sites of interest for developers that wish to start learning about EOSIO technology.

With this collaboration with the Proton team, Edenia also announces our candidacy as a Block Producer on the Proton Chain. We believe in the potential and relevance of this network and wish to bring our experience managing bare metal servers, developing blockchain infrastructure, and building dApps into this ecosystem. Also, we have experience running different blockchain networks from our data center in Costa Rica, which may add [regional diversity into the network](https://eoscostarica.io/block-producer/).

## Get to Know Proton

![Proton app](/img/blog/proton-affiliate/proton-app.png)

Proton announced the launch of the Proton Mainnet in April 2020. So far, 21 validators are producing blocks on Proton. Designed to work with high-volume apps, it offers several features to streamline payment processing, including identity verification, zero gas fees, and industry-leading speed (reaching up to 4,000 transactions per second). Known as “the payment blockchain,” it uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism and allows Proton (XPR) token holders to select block producers by voting.

Regulated by a Governing Council, Proton offers a decentralized governance model that requires pre-qualifying as a block producer candidate, compliance review, and a unique voting system for all council members. Proton enables the allocation of network resources where apps can rent while inflation rewards help fund the protocol development. Also, long-term Proton token holders may earn staking rewards in exchange for their votes.

Moreover, Proton offers a Proton wallet mobile app that enables users to store multiple cryptocurrencies in one place. It also allows integration with hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor.

In particular, the Proton [Affiliate Program](https://earnproton.com/) allows anyone with a Proton wallet and a completed KYC (Know Your Client) profile to refer new users to the app. They will be able to send a referral code and earn rewards in return for every invitee that signs up and completes the on-boarding process. This referral will be stored on a smart contract, preventing abuse on the network.

Once a new user receives this referral link, they will be prompted to choose a username and he or she will have 72 hours to download the Proton wallet, create an account, and go through the KYC process. After these few steps, their wallet will be active and ready to be used. Then, the person who referred the new user will receive payment automatically in XPR, the Proton native token, as a reward.

The Proton [Affiliate Program](https://earnproton.com/) is in the beta stage (only for selected countries) and welcomes new and existing Proton users to help us validate its functionalities. If you have any questions or comments, please join the conversation on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/eoscr).

## About Proton

Capable of up to 4,000 transactions per second, and with zero gas fees, Proton is a simple and accessible way to make cryptocurrency swaps, microtransactions, NFT trades, and more.
