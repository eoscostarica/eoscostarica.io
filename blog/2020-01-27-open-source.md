## What Is An Open-Source Project?

Participating in an open-source project may bring you several perks, and it won’t necessarily mean immediate compensation. An open-source project is built by the community and for the community. There is an implicit agreement to use the source code, design documents, and original content of the product freely. So, why get involved in an open-source project?

People from many backgrounds can participate in open-source projects, including software devs, UX and visual designers, communications professionals, among others. There are countless reasons why people choose to cooperate in an open-source project, and those include:

<!--truncate-->

1.  **I want to support a project in which I believe:** For some, supporting what they think is the right cause may be enough to get involved in an open-source project. The motivations behind this may be altruistic or simply because they want to give back to a community that supported them in the past.
2.  **I’m looking for networking opportunities:** Participating in an open-source project means joining an exciting community of professionals in many areas of knowledge. It can become an excellent chance for networking with members of this community, which may lead to new business opportunities in the future.
3.  **I want to learn new skills:** Contributing to an open-source project can help you acquire new knowledge. An open-source project usually groups people willing to collaborate across the whole process. Consequently, you won’t need to be an expert to get involved! You may find a task to do based on your level of experience. For instance, a good starting point is to create or improve documentation on the process. Later you can think about experimenting with your first pull request.
4.  **I want to be part of something relevant: **Being part of an open-source initiative may be both rewarding and an excellent way to join a community with similar interests to yours.
5.  **I’m looking for career opportunities: **Participating in an open-source community may open the doors to new recruiting opportunities, or at the very least, help you gather more experience to enrich your CV and repository. For example, we at EOS Costa Rica have employed people that started working with open-source initiatives and are now working with international scope projects.
6.  **I’m seeking external rewards: **On many occasions, those who contribute to open-source projects are looking for different types of rewards apart from wages. For instance, it can be a way to obtain access to a specific tool or software that the community works with or to receive future rewards. You must only have to play your cards right.
7.  Lastly, **contributing to open-source projects is fun!** For those who enjoy coding, this might be an exciting and worthwhile opportunity. Also, many open-source communities invite contributors to events or other group activities.

## Why Get Involved in Our Open-Source Project?

We currently have an open-source project on our Github that is related to blockchain technology. EOS Rate is a decentralized app that will allow EOS token holders to rate [Block Producers](https://eoscostarica.io/enterprise-blockchain-solutions/transparency/) easily. These ratings may help increase transparency and trust within the EOSIO network. Please take a look at it on [our Github here](https://github.com/eoscostarica/eos-rate).

All in all, if you’ve wanted to get involved in a blockchain-related project, this may be your chance. We’re seeking developers with experience using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and knowledge on Javascript and C++ to help code smart contracts.

[EOSIO protocol](https://eos.io/) appeared as a third-generation blockchain technology from a white paper published by the company Block.one. In essence, EOSIO is a decentralized blockchain infrastructure that emulates the attributes of computer hardware, including CPU, RAM, and memory. Thus, it means that the platform can be customized for many uses cases, including the private and public sectors, leading the processing of applications seamlessly and securely.

[Block.one closed an ICO](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-eos) (initial coin offering) in June 2018, raising more than US$4 billion by selling 1 billion tokens. Such investment is living proof of the network’s potential to generate impact and disruption in the blockchain ecosystem.

### Why Is It Important to Rate EOSIO Block Producers?

EOSIO protocol uses a unique consensus mechanism known as “Delegated Proof of Stake” (DPoS). Therefore, it requires the election of 21 nodes that will remain as Block Producers. These Block Producers are the [custodians of the EOSIO network](https://eos.io/faq/what-are-block-producers/), and they are responsible for validating and verifying transactions. EOS token-holders vote to elect the custodians.

We believe in the importance of rating Block Producers and candidates to measure whether the sentiment of the community is genuinely reflected in voting patterns to boost transparency in the network.
