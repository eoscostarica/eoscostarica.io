## About the Agreement

*[EOSTARTER](https://eostarter.org/)* and *[EOS Costa Rica](https://eoscostarica.io/)*, the arm of *Edenia* focused on developing on the EOS Mainnet, announce that both companies have entered a strategic agreement to develop a Token Sale Platform as the core technology to drive EOSTARTER’s Token Launchpad on EOS. The Token Sale Smart Contract enables projects to crowdsource through a token sale, configuring different parameters like whitelisting requirements and token vesting. 

The teams of EOSTARTER and EOS Costa Rica have started working on the [Platform Application](https://github.com/eostarter/token-sale-platform) and the [Platform’s smart contract](https://github.com/eostarter/eostarter.sale-smart-contract) open-source GitHub repositories. The Token Sale Platform offers a suite of services for investors and project owners seeking funding. Project owners will set up a token sale pool, configure the parameters, and launch a public token sale. Upon EOSTARTER’s approval, the token sale will begin on the established sale date and vest accordingly for investors and project owners.

## The Platform in Detail

The  Platform Application will be built on top of an open-source Smart Contract deployed on the EOS Mainnet. The project owner deposits project tokens to be held by the smart contract in order to be sold at a predetermined price for EOS tokens that will also be held by the smart contract. Investors and Project owners can then claim their tokens according to transparent rules and vesting schedules stored on-chain. You can view the initial platform’s [user flow here](https://medium.com/eostarter/eostarter-tokensale-platform-scope-of-work-4cb153c33ab6).

The Token Sale Platform proposal became one of the most backed initiatives by the EOS community during the first season of the Pomelo Grant, having received support from over 185 contributors and more than US$20K in matching funds from the ENF. Review our application [here](https://pomelo.io/grants/eostartertsc). Additionally to developing the smart contracts, we expect to include other features for a broader scope of the platform.

“We couldn’t be more excited to announce this partnership that will enable us to deliver on the promise of an equitable project launchpad for the EOS Ecosystem that we proposed on our Pomelo Grant Proposal,” said Hernan Arber from EOSTARTER. “All the project’s development costs will be transparent on the EOSTARTER account, and the code will be open-sourced as a public good for the entire EOS Ecosystem.” 

“Our team is excited and honored to be the core development group to build the smart contracts behind the Token Sale Platform. We believe that our skillset and tech stack will add value to EOS token holders and investors,” said Edgar Fernández from EOS Costa Rica/Edenia. “To this point, we are confident the Platform will exceed the expectations of the Pomelo grant supporters who trusted the proposal as a potentially impactful idea and EOS Costa Rica will become the ‘go-to’ dev team for the future Pomelo grants.”

Hernan Arber also referred to the EOS Costa Rica team: “their professionalism and technical abilities have been delivering consistent improvements to our community and they are the key developers of the EOS Rate tool among many important EOS projects.”
