## Get to Know Game X Change

IMAGEN 2

Game X Change offers gamers a service to safely move assets such as virtual cash and NFTs between platforms, games, or blockchains. It uses a utility token known as EXP (previously TTT) that rewards users for playing games linked to their platform. Furthermore, gamers can use EXP to purchase in-game assets such as weapons. 

The platform aims to provide gamers with new ways to interact with their communities. Users can play and earn by transferring digital assets between games, importing purchased NFTs into games, converting currencies into $EXP tokens, and buying exclusive NFTs in the marketplace. Game X Change users can also play a growing library of connected Steam games like PUBG, Rocket League, Destiny 2, CSGO, GTA V, The Witcher, and Rust; and convert achievements into $EXP. 

Moreover, Game X Change enables game developers to incorporate blockchain technology into their projects by leveraging digital assets and EXP tokens – or their own currency – to add more functionalities and layers to the gaming experience. Game X Change will also feature a decentralized governing system and lets users stake $EXP  and NFTs to earn additional rewards. 

## What’s Coming Next with the WAX Integration

WAX (Worldwide Asset eXchange™), launched in 2017, is the world’s most proven and eco-friendly blockchain for NFTs, video games, and collectibles, as stated in the [official website](https://on.wax.io/wax-io/). Often called “The King of NFTs,” WAX enables developers to build or upgrade decentralized apps, games, marketplaces, and more platforms seeking a scalable, robust and eco-friendly blockchain. Several brands, including Topps, Capcom, Atari, Funko, and Lionsgate, have launched their NFT collections on WAX. 

The decision to integrate Game X Change into WAX is based on this blockchain’s features that allow users to conveniently exchange NFTs and other digital assets. More than [15 million daily transactions](https://dappradar.com/industry-overview) from 325k users are deployed every day on WAX. Currently, it hosts several play-to-earn games such as [Alien Worlds](https://alienworlds.io/), [R-Planet](https://rplanet.io/), [Kolobok Adventures](https://wax.kolobok.io/), and [Prospectors](https://prospectors.io/). 

Game X Change users can mint and store their NFTs and fungible tokens in Binance and Ethereum. With this new integration, users will be able to use WAX to either mint NFTs on WAX or transfer them to WAX if there’s already an NFT in one of the other blockchains. Game X Change also features the EXP token of which can now be issued and stored in the WAX blockchain when first linked to a Binance or Ethereum wallet. 

"I'm super excited about integrating with the WAX Ecosystem. There have always been a whole host of games and projects that we wanted to collaborate with, and now is the perfect opportunity," said Haniff Knight, COO of Game X Change. "Partnering with Edenia has been a great experience. The partnership has allowed us to exchange a vast wealth of knowledge and understanding of the WAX Ecosystem that will prove beneficial as we push our multichain goals."
